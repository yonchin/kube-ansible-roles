#### To set up ssh access via public keys ###################

You can use this to deploy your public key to all the nodes.  Just put the user
password for all nodes in ~/sshpassword and make sure you have sshpass installed.
See the comments in keys.yml to explain the failing ping and offer some other
options.

$ ansible-playbook -i inventory pre-setup/ping.yml # This will look like it fails, that's ok
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory pre-setup/keys.yml
